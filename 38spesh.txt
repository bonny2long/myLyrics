Ayo
They was sleep, now they wakin' up
When it's people that can't stomach to see you, they gon' hate your guts
Put my gun down, pick the apron up
Stop robbin' and start hustlin, 'cause robbin' ain't make enough
All y'all fake as fuck, you sayin' what?
I'm 'posed to fear you? I barely hear you like my phone breakin' up
Y'all don't make enough
You say it's nine thousand, that's the square footage of space that my home takin' up
Your work show what you love and what you know
I'm nice but that quote came from Saint Bruno
You lazy and broke, I refuse to save you hoes
Y'all was in shape then y'all bitches became sumos
Me and my right hand had the same Hublots
We ain't never hate on each other, we gave kudos
Now my bars from Mars and my chain Pluto
And we all got black cards like the game UNO
Trust
