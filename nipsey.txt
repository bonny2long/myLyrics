Overtime (Overtime) 'cause I ain't have a mic
I was in that Chevy playin' Savage Life
Niggas lookin' like I had it wrong (Wrong)
Now them niggas know I had it right (Right)
They don't know about them sleepless nights
Them lookin' for a reason nights
They say it's six degrees in life
Opportunity, preparation, they meet, it's nice (Nice, nice)
