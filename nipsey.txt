Overtime (Overtime) 'cause I ain't have a mic
I was in that Chevy playin' Savage Life
Niggas lookin' like I had it wrong (Wrong)
Now them niggas know I had it right (Right)
They don't know about them sleepless nights
Them lookin' for a reason nights
They say it's six degrees in life
Opportunity, preparation, they meet, it's nice (Nice, nice)


"A necessary evil,

Ain't that the term you use?

Hundred thousand something soldiers

Went to serve for you

So bury your people and let them burn for you

Over some oil 'cause the issue ain't concerning you."

"Since 9/11 you been talking about the threat we facing

And how you need a couple billion to protect the nation

But look, come to my hood I'll show you desperation

Kids dead at 13 like Devin Brown, with no explanation."

"And I don't care where you from

'Cause real recognize real

Every step is like chess;

The wrong move gets you killed

So we act on how we think

And never speak on how we feel."

"I'm tryin' to live my life, so when it's over I got no regrets

Keys to success, multiply what you approach with

Go to roll a dice, but the first time that you can go legit

Seize the opportunity, believe and take control of it

Then get on your marathon and grind it 'til it's over with."
